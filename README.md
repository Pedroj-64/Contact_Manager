**Warhammer 40K: A Brief History**  

Warhammer 40,000 (Warhammer 40K) is a grimdark sci-fi universe created by Games Workshop in 1987. Set in the **41st millennium**, it depicts a dystopian future of endless war, where humanity is ruled by the oppressive **Imperium of Man**, worshipping the nearly-dead **Emperor of Mankind** as a god.  

The galaxy is plagued by constant conflicts between factions like:  
- **The Imperium** â€“ A brutal, authoritarian human empire.  
- **Chaos** â€“ Corrupting forces of evil gods from the Warp.  
- **Orks** â€“ Savage, war-hungry aliens.  
- **Eldar & Dark Eldar** â€“ Ancient, dying races with psychic powers.  
- **Necrons** â€“ Undead-like robotic conquerors.  
- **Tyranids** â€“ A monstrous hive mind devouring all life.  
- **Tau Empire** â€“ A relatively young and idealistic faction.  

The setting is defined by **war, corruption, and despair**, with no true "good guys." The phrase **"In the grim darkness of the far future, there is only war"** perfectly sums up its brutal tone. Over the years, Warhammer 40K has expanded through novels, video games, and an extensive tabletop miniatures game.
